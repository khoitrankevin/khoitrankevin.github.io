<h1> WEB MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUIZ APPLICATION </h1>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Web Multiple-Choice Quiz Application is an interactive educational tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Its main purpose is to provide an engaging, accessible, and lightweight platform for users to practice and test their knowledge in a variety of subjects directly from their web browser.

Unlike traditional quizzes that require server-side processing or external databases, this application runs entirely on the client side, meaning all data and logic are handled by the user’s browser. This makes it extremely easy to deploy, maintain, and share.
The quiz can be hosted on any static web server (or even run locally) without the need for back-end integration.

Through a simple yet effective interface, users can move through questions one at a time, select answers, receive visual feedback on correctness, and view their total score at the end of the quiz. The system is flexible enough to be reused for different subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, or computer science simply by editing the question data array in the JavaScript file.</p>

    <section id="purpose">
      <h2>Purpose and Objectives</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this web quiz project is to demonstrate the practical use of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic to build an educational interface that is both functional and visually appealing.
It is designed to help learners and instructors achieve the following goals:

Engagement: Encourage active learning through immediate feedback.

Accessibility: Provide a quiz that can run on any modern web browser without installation.

Portability: Allow educators to easily customize questions and topics by modifying a single data structure in the code.

Reusability: Make the system modular so it can be integrated into larger e-learning websites or lesson modules.

Simplicity: Use plain web technologies that are easy for beginners to understand and extend.

In essence, this project aims to combine simplicity, interactivity, and educational value within a single small web application.</p>

      <h2>Core Features</h2>
      <p>The system provides the following key features:

Dynamic Question Display: Each question is loaded one at a time, reducing visual clutter and helping users focus.

Multiple-Choice Selection: Users can select one of several possible answers for each question.

Immediate Feedback: After a selection, the correct and incorrect answers are visually highlighted.

Scoring System: The total number of correct responses is tracked and displayed at the end of the quiz.

Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts for both desktop and mobile devices using modern CSS.

Restart Option: Users can replay the quiz multiple times to improve their scores.

Simple Configuration: All questions, options, and correct answers are stored in a JavaScript array, making it easy to edit or expand.</p>

    <section id="stack">
      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <p>HTML5: Defines the structure of the quiz, including question text, buttons, and score elements.

CSS3: Handles the design, layout, and responsiveness, ensuring that the quiz looks modern and clean on all screen sizes.

JavaScript (ES6): Controls the quiz logic — loading questions, verifying answers, updating the score, and managing user interactions.

No external libraries or frameworks are required, though the application can easily be expanded using React, Vue, or Angular if desired.

    <section id="audience">
      <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
      <p>This project and its documentation are intended for:

Students learning web development who want a hands-on example of applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.

Educators who wish to create quick online tests or homework assignments for their classes.

Developers seeking a lightweight quiz template that can be extended into a larger web application or integrated with APIs and databases.

Because of its clear structure and open design, it serves both as an educational resource and as a foundation for more advanced e-learning systems.</p>
